# wordguess

First real project completed in Javascript. The letters guessed correctly are automatically placed in the word, leaving the underscores for unguessed letters. incorrectly are listed beneath the correct guesses.

Basic logic:
Underscores are placed as word length, and keypresses are checked against every index in the word. Correct guesses replace the underscore with the appropriate letter at the specified index.
